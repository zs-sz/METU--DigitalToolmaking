# I. Tilemap (rectangular 3D or 2D)

### Description

### Elements to deliver:

- six individual  .png per kit (tile dimensions are up to you but all six has to be the same)
- same goes for 3D models
- one full hd (1920x1080) screenshot with all six on a 3x2 grid (centered)
- One or more rendered view (1920x1080) from blender (using the example files)
- a few lines of description of reasoning (whys and whats)



II. Trimsheet Texture on Exponential Grid (dream uv extension)

- see examples here

### Elements to deliver:

- 3 different textures, each 2048 by 2048 (at least)
